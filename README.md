- 👋 Hi, I’m @necusrocus
- 👀 I’m interested in trying to learn how to code specific apps for my day job in telecom consulting. I would like to build an app to add different predefined symbols
to a google map that would be specific to my industry. Part of my job now is that I go out and map out all of the utilities in the right of way and have to draw it up by hand
at the moment. I have looked into possibly changing the workflow to getting the geo points with a high end survey grade gps reciever and coding each point to transfer to the 
correct symbol when it gets imported to AutoCad. This would be in the form of a .CSV file. But that way would take a bit more time in the field and be pretty expensive investment 
for each field person. If I can manage to build this app with a library of all the symbols I use, and also a form that comes with adding a symbol so that I can get attributes for 
for each data point, I think I could make it work pretty well and pretty happy with it. I would like to make the app for mobile platforms. Android to start and I would also like 
the app to export a .CSV file of the data points and a KMZ file as well. The KMZ doesn't have to carry over the symbology, although that would be nice, but I have a feeling that 
may be quite a bit more dificult. All I really need is the .CSV file as long as I can see the symbols correctly on my device at the time. 

Also I would like to get into programming audio plug ins. I am a musician and a sound engineer. That's my real passion in life, but the other job seems easier to make a living
and stay local and be home with the family. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic coding, although I took C++ in college, but didn't make it far even though I passed. About all I ever managed to do with it is make some 
pretty fancy Excel spreadsheets. Lol. I would like to get a lot better at Python and Java/Javascript. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone willing to help me learn. I'm a newbie when it comes to this. I'm just hear to try to learn while maybe trying to actually make
something in the process. 

- 📫 How to reach me .. I'm scared to put my email on here but if you took a guess and added @gmail you would probably be right.
